### Issues and Recommendations

1. **Duplicate Code in Validation Functions**:
   Each of your checking functions (`checkWP`, `checkTwoCorr`, `checkOneCorr`) contains similar patterns of looping and checking. You might be able to abstract this behavior into a single function that accepts parameters for the arrays and conditions.

2. **Use of Global Variable `winning`**:
   The variable `winning` is reused across multiple functions which could lead to issues if not properly managed. Consider passing it as a parameter or using a different approach to maintain state.

3. **Changing Form Data Access**:
   In the `checkAnswer` function, you access form values directly through the `input1.value`, etc. Since you have them in the `formData`, you should continue using that.

4. **Inefficient Checking**:
   You're using `indexOf` to check if an item exists and to control conditional flow. A more efficient way would be to use a `Set` which provides O(1) average time complexity for existence checks.

5. **Repeated Event Listeners**:
   If this code runs each time the form is submitted, be wary that repeated submissions might accumulate event listeners unnecessarily. Ensure they’re attached only when needed.

### Refactoring Example

Here’s a refactored version of your code incorporating some of the above suggestions:

```javascript
form.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    const formData = new FormData(form);
    const inputs = [formData.get('input1'), formData.get('input2'), formData.get('input3')].map(Number);

    if (!inputs.every(val => !isNaN(val))) {
        alert('You must enter all three numbers');
        return;
    }

    if (new Set(inputs).size !== inputs.length) { // Check for duplicates using a Set
        alert('Repetition of digits is not allowed');
        return;
    }

    const winning = checkWinningConditions(inputs);
    message.innerText = winning ? 'Congratulations,\nyou won!' : 'You lost... Better luck next time!';
    
    blackOut.classList.add('over');
    messageModal.classList.add('show');
});

function checkWinningConditions(answer) {
    return [
        checkCondition(answer, wPArray, 1),
        checkCondition(answer, twoCorrArr, 2),
        checkCondition(answer, oneCorrArr, 1),
        !checkCondition(answer, noCorrArr, 0),
    ].every(condition => condition);
}

function checkCondition(answer, arr, expectedCount) {
    let count = 0;
    const answerSet = new Set(answer);
  
    for (let index = 0; index < arr.length; index++) {
        if (answerSet.has(arr[index])) {
            if (answer.indexOf(arr[index]) !== index) {
                return false; // Condition failed
            }
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count === expectedCount;
}
```

### Changes Made

1. **Unified Check**: The `checkWinningConditions` function now manages the condition checks which reduces redundancy.
2. **Use of `Set`**: Duplicate checks are now managed using a `Set` for cleaner and potentially faster performance.
3. **Improved Validation**: Validation is concise and utilizes array methods to check for completeness.
4. **Clearer Logic**: The structure and naming conventions help clarify purpose and flow, making your code easier to read.

### Conclusion

These adjustments improve the efficiency and readability of your JavaScript. Make sure to test the refactored code thoroughly to ensure that it maintains the intended functionality. If you have specific inputs or expected outputs, running tests will help confirm the changes work as expected. If you have further questions or need additional help, feel free to ask!
